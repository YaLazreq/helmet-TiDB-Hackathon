"Hey everyone, I'm Eliane."

Y: 
"And I'm Yanis, and for the TiDB AgenticX Hackathon 2025, we built Helmet."

E: 
Today, construction delays burn thousands per day. 
When something breaks on a construction site, problems cascade. 
One delay shifts tasks across multiple days, and reorganization takes hours and hours. 
Every delay costs thousands, and the whole site can grind to a halt.

Y:
On site, workers don't have time to type tickets. So we made it simple - Helmet starts with voice.

[DEMO: Show a map with the problem. Yanis takes the phone and explains the problem to Helmet]

Y:
And this is where our Multi-Agent Architecture powered by LangGraph takes control.

E:
Our Supervisor Agent is the orchestrator - 
it analyzes every request and intelligently routes it through our specialized agent network using LangGraph's StateGraph.

Y:
The Planning Agent is our strategic brain. It doesn't just schedule - 
it runs direct SQL queries against TiDB to validate constraints, 
detects conflicts with our specialized Conflict Agent, and creates comprehensive resolution plans.

E:
But here's what makes it truly intelligent: 
when workers describe tasks or need reassignments, 
our system uses TiDB Vector Search with semantic embeddings.

This means if a worker says 'the electrical thing in the office is broken,' our vector database automatically 
finds the exact task and the best-qualified worker - no more questions needed."

Y:
All our agents communicate through our custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, 
giving them access to 15 specialized database tools."

The Notifier Agent always closes the loop - 
it creates structured notifications with executable actions sent to the Supervisor, 
ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

It is here where the magic happens.
The Construction Site Supervisor receives a clear, concise summary of the issue,
the proposed solution, and a one-click approval button.

Y:
"Finally, the Executor Agent then applies all changes atomically and safely when the supervisor approves."

E:
We've just moved four critical tasks and assigned three people.
We've unlocked the construction site entrance and initiated a safety procedure.
in XXX seconds.

Y:
The vision is simple: construction sites that will never stop, pivoting live.
